# Healthcare-data-prediction

The application contains code for three types of prediction models:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Binary Classification
- Multi-Class Classification

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about patients and their medical history. It is used to predict the medical cost of patients based on the features present in the dataset.

## Multiple Linear Regression: Comprehensive Billing Prediction

### Instructions:
1. Prepare the dataset by encoding categorical variables like Gender and Admission Type and handling any missing data.
2. Construct a multiple linear regression model with Age, Gender, and Admission Type as predictors for Billing Amount.
3. Interpret the model coefficients to determine which factors are significant predictors of billing amounts in a healthcare context.

## Binary Classification: Normal vs. Abnormal/Inconclusive Test Results

### Instructions:
1. Convert the Test Results into binary classes where 'Normal' is one class and 'Abnormal'/'Inconclusive' are combined into another.
2. Choose suitable features and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Implement and evaluate a logistic regression model, using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Discuss the key predictors for normal test results and explore potential reasons for misclassifications.

## Multi-Class Classification: Detailed Prediction of Test Results

### Instructions:
1. Ensure comprehensive preprocessing including encoding of categorical variables and imputation of missing values.
2. Utilize features encompassing patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital-related information to predict Test Results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive) using a decision tree classifier.
3. Evaluate the model with a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics for each class.
4. Provide insights based on the model's predictions, discuss misclassifications, and offer recommendations for healthcare professionals based on these insights.
